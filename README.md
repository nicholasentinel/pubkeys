# pubkeys
public keys to be downloaded for lab machines on boot

to add your key: request to be added as a collaborator, pull master (I recommend authenticating via github ssh keys), create a branch and add your user name to the users file and one ssh key to the corresponding line in the authorized_keys file. you should always be adding to the nth line of eath file, if the line counts of the files differ the user creation job will be rejected.
